# STS 499: An explorative analysis into statistical methods for image denoising

## Introduction
In this endeavor, Aidan Draper and his research advisor, Dr. Laura Taylor, investigate the presence of statistical concepts and methodology that underly many of the open-sourced, computer vision packages available. In addition, they attempt to debunk the idea that computer vision methodology is moving away from statistical approaches, and instead, towards unsupervised learning frameworks.
